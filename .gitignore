# This defines a bunch of files and folders that we want to keep out of our git repository.

# So for example temporary file uploads that you might be doing in development or testing -
# we don't want to save those to our git repo.

# So those are listed here by default but also there's some important ones like your /config/master.key
# which allows you to decrypt your rails credentials which is used for api-keys and another secrets you
# need to store in your application.

# This allows you to encrypt that file but you don't ever save the key to decrypt it in your git repo,
# because if anybody get access to your git repository they can steel all your token which would be bad!

# So it's why the key is ignored, so does not get saved to your git repo.
# But you need to make sure to save that somewhere safe.

# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
